Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for predictive analysis and finding the linear relationship between variables.


Characteristics

Type: Regression Analysis.
Linear Model: Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Equation: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$  for simple linear.
Assumptions:

1.	Linearity: The relationship between  x  and  y  is linear.
2.	Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
3.	Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors.
4.	Normality: The residuals (errors) of the model are normally distributed.

How It Works

1.	Data Collection: Gather data for the dependent and independent variables.
2.	Model Specification: Define the linear regression model equation.
3.	Estimation of Parameters: Use the least squares method to estimate the parameters ( $\beta_0$  and  $\beta_1$ ).
4.	Prediction: Use the estimated model to make predictions.
5.	Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and residual plots.

Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for predictive analysis and finding the linear relationship between variables.

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

Characteristics

	•	Type: Regression Analysis
	•	Linear Model: Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables
	•	Equation:  $'y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x'$  for simple linear regression, where  y  is the dependent variable,  x  is the independent variable,  $\beta_0$  is the y-intercept, and  $\beta_1$  is the slope Equation:  $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$  for simple linear 
	•	Assumptions:  $$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
	•	Linearity: The relationship between  x  and  y  is linear.
	•	Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
	•	Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors.
	•	Normality: The residuals (errors) of the model are normally distributed.

How It Works

	1.	Data Collection: Gather data for the dependent and independent variables.
	2.	Model Specification: Define the linear regression model equation.
	3.	Estimation of Parameters: Use the least squares method to estimate the parameters ( $\beta_0$  and  $\beta_1$ ).
	4.	Prediction: Use the estimated model to make predictions.
	5.	Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and residual plots.
